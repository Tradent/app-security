### Task: Initial system design - Enhanced

Incorporating network management and public blockchain access for a metered WiFi connection system managed by ThePublic's infrastructure adds a layer of complexity and security to our system.

#### Enhanced Components:
1. **Network Management**:
   - **Router Integration**: Integration with network routers to manage and control WiFi connections.
   - **Bandwidth Management**: Implementing mechanisms to control and monitor bandwidth usage for metered connections.
   - **Quality of Service (QoS)**: Prioritizing network traffic to ensure reliable and efficient data transfer.
   - **Network Monitoring**: Monitoring network performance, usage, and security.

2. **Public Blockchain Access**:
   - **Smart Contracts**: Implementing smart contracts on a public blockchain for managing metered connections.
   - **Transaction Processing**: Processing transactions on the blockchain for users to access and pay for WiFi usage.
   - **Secure Authentication**: Using blockchain for secure and transparent authentication and authorization processes.
   - **Immutable Data Storage**: Storing critical network and transaction data on the blockchain for tamper-proof records.

#### Interaction Flow with Network Management and Blockchain:
1. User requests a WiFi connection through the frontend UI.
2. Frontend triggers actions to setup a metered connection through the network management system.
3. Network management system controls bandwidth and quality of service based on the user's subscription.
4. The system interacts with the public blockchain for authentication and payment verification.
5. Smart contracts manage the transaction of WiFi usage and payment between the user and ThePublic's infrastructure.
6. Network performance and transaction data are stored securely on the blockchain for auditability and transparency.

#### Data Flow with Network Management and Blockchain:
1. User initiates a connection request, including user details and desired bandwidth.
2. Network management system allocates bandwidth based on the subscription plan and QoS requirements.
3. Blockchain verifies user authentication and payment details for access control.
4. Smart contracts handle transactions for WiFi usage, deducting credits based on usage.
5. Network monitoring data and transaction records are securely stored on the blockchain for auditing and billing purposes.

This enhanced system design incorporating network management and public blockchain access is aimed at providing a secure, scalable, and transparent metered WiFi connection system managed by ThePublic's infrastructure. I will update the `system-design` feature branch with these enhancements. Let me know if you have any specific requirements or further details to include.
